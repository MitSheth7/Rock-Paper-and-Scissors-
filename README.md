# instructions 

1. The program starts by creating a Random object to generate random numbers, which will be used to determine the computer’s choice in the game.
2. It then enters a loop that continues as long as the player wants to keep playing. This is controlled by the playAgain boolean variable.
3. Inside this loop, the program first asks the player to enter their choice of “ROCK”, “PAPER”, or “SCISSORS”. This choice is stored in the player variable.
4. The computer’s choice is determined by generating a random number between 1 and 3, each corresponding to “ROCK”, “PAPER”, or “SCISSORS”. This choice is stored in the computer variable.
5. The program then displays both the player’s and the computer’s choices.
6. The winner of the game is determined based on the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beat Paper, and Paper beats Rock. If both the player and the computer make the same choice, it’s a draw.
7. After the result is displayed, the program asks the player if they want to play again. If the player answers “Y”, the game loop continues. Otherwise, the game ends.
8. Finally, the program displays a thank you message and waits for a key press before closing.

To run this code, you need to have a C# compiler installed on your machine. Here are the steps to run it:

1. Save the code in a file with a .cs extension, for example, RockPaperScissors.cs.
2. Open a command prompt or terminal window.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4. Compile the code using the C# compiler. If you’re using the .NET Core SDK, the command would be dotnet build.
5. Run the compiled code. If you’re using the .NET Core SDK, the command would be dotnet run.
6. The game will start in your console, and you can play by following the prompts.
